# The Next-Generation Sass Module System

This repository houses a proposal for the `@use` directive and associated module
system, which is intended to be the headlining feature for Sass 4. This is a
*living proposal*: it's intended to evolve over time, and is hosted on GitHub to
encourage community collaboration and contributions. Any suggestions or issues
can be brought up and discussed on [the issue tracker][issues].

*Note: at the time of writing, the initial draft of the proposal is not yet
complete*.

## Background

The new `@use` directive is intended to supercede Sass's `@import` directive as
the standard way of sharing styles across Sass files. `@import` is the simplest
form of re-use: it does little more than directly include the target file in the
source file. This has caused numerous problems in practice: including the same
file more than once slows down compilation and produces redundant output, users
must manually namespace everything in their libraries, and there's no
encapsulation to allow them to keep moving pieces hidden.

The new module system is intended to address these shortcomings (among others)
and bring Sass's modularity into line with the best practices as demonstrated by
other modern languages. As such, the semantics of `@use` are is heavily based on
other languages' module systems, with Python and Dart being particularly strong
influences.

## Goals

### High-Level

These are the philosophical design goals for the module system at large. While
they don't uniquely specify a system, they do represent the underlying
motivations behind many of the lower-level design decisions.

* **Locality**. The module system should make it possible to understand a Sass
  file by looking only at that file. An important aspect of this is that names
  in the file should be resolved based on the contents of the file rather than
  the global state of the compilation. This also applies to authoring: an author
  should be able to be confident that a name is safe to use as long as it
  doesn't conflict with any name visible in the file.

* **Encapsulation**. The module system should allow authors, particularly
  library authors, to choose what API they expose. They should be able to define
  entities for internal use without making those entities available for external
  users to access or modify. This also includes the ability to "forward" public
  APIs from another file.

* **Configuration**. Sass is unusual among languages in that it encourages the
  use of files whose entire purpose is to produce side effects—specifically, to
  emit CSS. There's also a broader class of libraries that may not emit CSS
  directly, but do define configuration variables that are used in computations,
  sometimes at the top level. The module system should allow the user to
  flexibly use modules with side-effects, and shouldn't force global
  configuration.

### Low-Level

These are goals that are based less on philosophy than on practicality. For the
most part, they're derived from user feedback that we've collected about
`@import` over the years.

* **Using CSS files**. People often have CSS files that they want to bring into
  their Sass compilation. Historically, `@import` has been unable to do this due
  to its overlap with the plain-CSS `@import` directive and the requirement that
  SCSS remain a CSS superset. With a new directive name, this becomes possible.

* **Import once**. Because `@import` is a literal textual inclusion, multiple
  `@import`s of the same Sass file within the scope of a compilation will
  compile and run that file multiple times. At best this hurts compilation time,
  and it can also contribute to bloated CSS output when the styles themselves
  are duplicated. The new module system should only compile a file once, at
  least for the default configuration.

### Non-Goals

These are potential goals that we have explicitly decided to avoid pursuing for
various reasons. Some of them may be on the table for future work, but none are
expected to land in Sass 4.

* **Dynamic imports**. Allowing the path to a module to be defined dynamically,
  whether by including variables or including it in a conditional block, moves
  away from being declarative. In addition to making stylesheets harder to read,
  this makes any sort of static analysis more difficult—and actually impossible
  in the general case. It also limits the possibility of future implementation
  optimizations.

* **Importing multiple files at once**. In addition to the long-standing reason
  that this hasn't been supported—that it opens authors up to sneaky and
  difficult-to-debug ordering bugs—this violates the principle of locality by
  obfuscating which files are imported and thus where names come from.

* **Extend-only imports**. The idea of importing a file so that the CSS it
  generates isn't emitted unless it's `@extend`ed is cool, but it's also a lot
  of extra work. This is the most likely feature to end up in a future release,
  but it's not central enough to the module system to include in Sass 4.
